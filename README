HQ9+/H9+/HQ9++ Interpreter
==========================

After building, three executables will be in the bin folder, representing
an interpreter each. This is a very basic and simple implementation of
interpreters for these languages.
Build-time dependencies are clang, and GNU make. To build the project just
issue the 'make' command while in the project directory.
